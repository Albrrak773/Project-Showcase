    "Full Project Description": "This project aims to address the negative behavioral impacts of online gaming on children by developing a safe, educational multiplayer game. The system integrates real-time Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect and filter inappropriate language, enforce parental time limits, and promote positive in-game communication. When toxic behavior or excessive screen time is detected, the system responds by warning the player, offering better word alternatives, and recommending physical activities. By combining game development tools like Unity with sentiment analysis and Firebase for data handling, the game not only ensures fun and engagement but also encourages healthier digital habits, improved social interactions, and better academic balance for children.\n",

    "Full Project Description": "Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a highly contagious respiratory illness that significantly burdens global public health systems each year. Early and accurate diagnosis of influenza types is essential to reduce the transmission of the virus, alleviate healthcare system pressure, and enhance patient outcomes. In response to these challenges, this project introduces the Flu App, a mobile-based diagnostic support tool designed to detect and classify flu types based on user-reported symptoms. The application combines rule-based classification techniques with machine learning models to provide a scalable and intelligent solution for flu diagnosis in real time.\n\nThe Flu App is developed as an integrated feature within the Sehhaty platform and leverages both artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods. User inputs—such as age, gender, chronic illness, and symptom presence—are analyzed using rule-based algorithms and trained classifiers to predict flu type severity. The project applies well-established classification algorithms, including PART, OneR, JRIP, and J48, implemented via the WEKA platform, to ensure model accuracy and interpretability.\n\nThe system's architecture follows the Waterfall model, comprising the following phases: data collection, requirements analysis, classification model development, implementation, and performance evaluation. The dataset utilized for training includes real-world cases gathered from hospitals across Qassim, Saudi Arabia. To optimize model performance, rigorous preprocessing methods such as handling missing values, discretization, feature selection, and normalization are applied. Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score are used to assess classifier performance.\n\nExperimental results indicate that the OneR algorithm achieved the highest classification accuracy (91.43%). However, due to its balance between accuracy and rule complexity, the PART algorithm (88.57% accuracy, 4 rules) is selected for final deployment. This decision ensures both high performance and ease of interpretation within a clinical support context.\n\nThe mobile app interface, designed using Figma, offers a user-friendly experience, featuring interactive symptom input forms, personalized diagnostic feedback, and guidance on next steps—whether home care or hospital referral. Users can also contact nearby hospitals directly via the integrated “Help & Support” section.\n\nUltimately, this project contributes a novel, practical, and intelligent digital health tool aimed at facilitating early flu detection and enhancing decision-making for users and healthcare providers. It represents a significant advancement in the application of AI in public health, especially in regions like Saudi Arabia, where flu outbreaks can overwhelm healthcare infrastructure. The project also lays a solid foundation for future enhancements, such as real-time data integration, expanded datasets, and telemedicine support.\n",
